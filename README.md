# Quantum Google QGP

This project demonstrates how to use the Google Quantum Engine to run quantum programs using the Cirq library.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Cirq library
- Google Quantum Engine API credentials

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/AndresCdo/quantum-google-qgp.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```shell
    pip install cirq
    ```

3. Set up your Google Quantum Engine API credentials. Refer to the official documentation for instructions.

## Usage

1. Open the `main.py` file in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.

2. Modify the code as needed. You can define your own quantum circuit and specify the target quantum processor.

3. Run the program:

    ```shell
    python main.py
    ```

4. The program will submit the quantum circuit to the Quantum Engine API and wait for the job to complete.

5. Once the job is finished, the result will be printed on the console.
